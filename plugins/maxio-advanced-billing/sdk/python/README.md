Maxio Advanced Billing (formerly Chargify) provides an HTTP-based API that conforms to the principles of REST.
One of the many reasons to use Advanced Billing is the immense feature set and [client libraries](page:development-tools/client-libraries).
The Maxio API returns JSON responses as the primary and recommended format, but XML is also provided as a backwards compatible option for merchants who require it.

## Steps to make your first Maxio Advanced Billing API call

1. [Sign-up](https://app.chargify.com/signup/maxio-billing-sandbox) or [log-in](https://app.chargify.com/login.html) to your [test site](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24250712113165-Testing-Overview) account.
2. [Setup authentication](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24294819360525-API-Keys) credentials.
3. [Submit an API request and verify the response](page:development-tools/client-libraries#make-your-first-maxio-advanced-billing-api-request).
5. Test the Advanced Billing [integrations](https://www.maxio.com/integrations).

Next, you can explore [authentication methods](page:introduction/authentication), [basic concepts](page:introduction/basic-concepts/connected-sites) for interacting with Advanced Billing via the API, and the entire set of [application-based documentation](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us) to aid in your discovery of the product.

### Request Example

The following example uses the curl command-line tool to make an API request.

**Request**

    curl -u <api_key>:x -H Accept:application/json -H Content-Type:application/json https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions.json

## Installation

Add the Python SDK to your project from its folder, with whichever package manager your project uses. Give each tool a path containing a slash, such as `../maxio-advanced-billing` — a bare folder name is looked up on PyPI instead, and resolves to whatever project holds that name there:

```bash
pip install <path-to-sdk>
```

```bash
uv add <path-to-sdk>
```

```bash
poetry add <path-to-sdk>
```

## Quick Start

### Synchronous client

Construct `MaxioAdvancedBillingClient` with keyword arguments, and call `close()` when you are done. Every argument is optional; the full list is in the [SDK map](sdk-map.md).

```python
from maxio_advanced_billing import MaxioAdvancedBillingClient
from maxio_advanced_billing.core import BasicAuthCredentials

client = MaxioAdvancedBillingClient(
    basic_auth=BasicAuthCredentials(username="YOUR_USERNAME", password="YOUR_PASSWORD"), environment="us"
)

# TODO: call endpoints here -- see api-reference.md

client.close()
```

Alternatively, scope it -- `with MaxioAdvancedBillingClient(...) as client:` closes the pool on exit; see [Best Practices](#best-practices).

`Client` is exported as an alias of `MaxioAdvancedBillingClient`, so `from maxio_advanced_billing import Client` also works.

The SDK accepts every model-typed input in two interchangeable spellings, both type-checked: the typed model, or a plain dict with the same keys -- the `OrDict` and `Model | ModelDict` unions in the [SDK map](sdk-map.md). Pick whichever suits the call site: the dict form needs no import, while the model form adds a keyword-checked constructor and editor completion.

### Asynchronous client

`AsyncMaxioAdvancedBillingClient` mirrors `MaxioAdvancedBillingClient` with **identical method names**, and every endpoint method is a coroutine. It takes the same arguments, with some differences -- for example, the transport argument is `custom_async_http_client`.

```python
from asyncio import run

from maxio_advanced_billing import AsyncMaxioAdvancedBillingClient
from maxio_advanced_billing.core import BasicAuthCredentials


async def main() -> None:
    client = AsyncMaxioAdvancedBillingClient(
        basic_auth=BasicAuthCredentials(username="YOUR_USERNAME", password="YOUR_PASSWORD"), environment="us"
    )
    # TODO: call endpoints here, awaiting each -- see api-reference.md
    await client.aclose()


run(main())
```

Alternatively, scope it -- `async with AsyncMaxioAdvancedBillingClient(...) as client:` closes the pool on exit. Only the async spelling is `aclose`, matching httpx2; see [Best Practices](#best-practices).

`AsyncClient` is the exported alias. Each client accepts **only** its own transport argument; passing the other's is a `TypeError` at runtime and an error under mypy.

## Usage

Two generated references cover the SDK; each answers a different question:

| Reference | For |
| --- | --- |
| **[API Reference](api-reference.md)** | Usage guidance for a single **parsed** operation: `client.<group>.<operation>(...)` returns the typed payload and raises `ApiError` on any non-2xx, with `.error` the typed error body, or `RawError` for a status the operation does not document. |
| **[Raw API Reference](raw-api-reference.md)** | The same for the **raw** variant: `client.<group>.with_raw_response.<operation>(...)` returns `ApiResult[T, E]` and never raises for an API error. |

Both API references carry every one of the 285 operations, with a sync and an async sample and a parameter table each.

## SDK map

This SDK ships a generated **SDK map** -- [`sdk-map.md`](sdk-map.md) -- a deterministic, lookup-oriented table of contents of the SDK's Python surface, generated by APIMatic alongside this SDK.

Consult the map before scanning or grepping the source: it answers call-level contract questions by lookup, and for anything it does not carry -- model shapes, enum values, an endpoint's route or behavioural prose -- it names the one source file to read. How to read the map itself, including the SDK-wide defaults its rows rely on, is stated at the top of [`sdk-map.md`](sdk-map.md).

## Logging

The SDK logs every HTTP exchange through Python's standard `logging` module, under the `maxio_advanced_billing` logger, and configures nothing itself: with no logging set up, nothing is printed unless `MAXIO_ADVANCED_BILLING_LOG` is set. Turn it on as for any library:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig()  # your application's handler; the root stays at WARNING
logging.getLogger("maxio_advanced_billing").setLevel(logging.INFO)  # the SDK's lines; DEBUG adds the dumps that logging_options turns on
```

Or set one environment variable before the process starts, for a run you cannot edit: `MAXIO_ADVANCED_BILLING_LOG=info` writes the request and response lines, `MAXIO_ADVANCED_BILLING_LOG=debug` adds the request headers, the request body and the response headers. If your application has configured logging, its handlers and format are used; otherwise the SDK writes to stderr.

Choose the detail with `logging_options`, a `LoggingOptions` from `maxio_advanced_billing.core`:

```python
from maxio_advanced_billing import MaxioAdvancedBillingClient
from maxio_advanced_billing.core import LoggingOptions

client = MaxioAdvancedBillingClient(
    logging_options=LoggingOptions(log_request_headers=True, log_response_headers=True, log_request_body=True)
)
```

A plain dict with the same keys is accepted too, as for every model-typed argument (see [Quick Start](#quick-start)): `logging_options={"log_request_headers": True}`.

| Option | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `log_request_headers` | `False` | Log the sent headers at DEBUG, masked. |
| `log_response_headers` | `False` | Log the received headers at DEBUG, masked. |
| `log_request_body` | `False` | Log the request body at DEBUG: its text when in memory, a description when streamed. |
| `body_size_limit` | `32768` | Bytes of a logged body kept before it is cut. |
| `redaction_placeholder` | `"REDACTED"` | What a hidden value prints as. |
| `unmask_headers` | none | Header names to show although they are not on the safe list. |
| `mask_headers` | none | Header names to hide although they are on the safe list. |
| `mask_keys` | 11 credential names | Query and form keys whose values are always hidden; naming a set replaces the default. |

A single call can be quietened with `request_options={"log_level": logging.WARNING}`: records below that level are not written for that call. It never turns on a record the client's options leave off. Header, query and form values print `REDACTED` unless known safe; a JSON body is printed as sent, so enable `log_request_body` only where its content may be logged; a response body is never logged. The levels and every field are under **Logging** in the SDK map.

## Best Practices

> [!TIP]
> Use a **single `MaxioAdvancedBillingClient` instance** for the lifetime of your application and reuse it across
> all requests. Each instance owns its own connection pool, so an instance per request forfeits
> connection reuse and leaks pools that are never closed.

Match the disposal to the client's lifetime: an application-lifetime client is closed once at shutdown with `close()` / `aclose()`; where the lifetime fits a block, `with MaxioAdvancedBillingClient() as client:` / `async with AsyncMaxioAdvancedBillingClient() as client:` releases it automatically. Both are idempotent, but a closed client is not reusable: the next call raises. The client closes **whatever transport it holds**, including one you supplied via `custom_http_client` / `custom_async_http_client`; if you intend to reuse your own transport across clients, don't hand its lifetime to a `with` block.

**Retries are on by default**: a failed idempotent request — a retryable status or no response at all — is sent again up to three times before the call gives up. Pass `retry_options=0` to turn it off, for instance in a test that stubs an error response; the policy and its defaults are under **Retries** in the SDK map.
