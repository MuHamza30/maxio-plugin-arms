    can't credit past what was originally granted). An out-of-bounds value is rejected rather than clamped. Zero is
    rejected. Without a ``grant_id`` (an overdraft correction), the amount must be positive, can't exceed the usage the
    overdraft entry still records, and can't exceed the overdraft the wallet still owes. Encoded as a decimal string

    by pointing at them. For a grant-attributed debit, it's recorded on the resulting ledger row for audit only: it does
    not change how ``amount`` is applied, and more than one adjustment may name the same row. For an overdraft entry, it

    adjustment checks. If given and the grant's current ``posted_remaining`` no longer matches, the request is rejected
    with ``409`` and nothing is written. Compared numerically, so ``"100"`` and ``"100.00000000"`` both match a
    ``posted_remaining`` of ``100``. Omit the field entirely to skip the check; sending it as an empty string is treated
